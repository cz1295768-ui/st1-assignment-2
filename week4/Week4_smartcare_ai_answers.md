# Problem Summary
SmartCare Community Clinic currently uses inefficient manual methods to manage patient information, resulting in various operational challenges. To improve efficiency and service quality, the clinic requires a simple software solution that can effectively support patient records, practitioner management, and appointment scheduling.

# Questions for the client
1. Who should be able to gain access to patients' medical records?
2. What functions should the system provide when booking an appointment?
3. What is the maximum number of users that may access the system at the same time?
4. What response should the system have if a patient cancels an appointment few minutes before its starting time?
5. What personal information is required when the user wants to log into the system?

# What we do not yet know
1. Security policies for users' sensitive data
2. The operational format clinic requires.
3. Whether online-payment method is required.

I can explain the final code requirements including management and appointment handling without AI response.
What do I still need to understand is the security rules and privacy protection contract for the user data.
